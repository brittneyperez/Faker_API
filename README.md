## Faker API

CORE Assignment #16.

In this assignment, two JavaScript libraries will be used to create a simple API that generates _User_ and _Company_ objects depending on the requested route. The libraries are **Express** for the server and **Faker** for the random data generation. The goal is to start broadening our understanding of APIs.

### Faker
To add Faker to the project it needs to be installed via `npm`.

```
npm install @faker-js/faker
```

For more information, see [Faker's API documentation](https://fakerjs.dev/api/address.html#city).
